## Introduction

The goal of this project is to automatically generate research paper titles based on the content of the paper. This can be particularly useful for researchers and writers looking for creative and informative titles for their work.

## Requirements

Before using the code in this repository, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Transformers library
- Pandas
- NumPy

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy

<h3>
Usage</h3>
To generate research paper titles using the pre-trained model, follow these steps:<br>

Clone this repository:<br>

bash<br>
1.Copy code<br>
2.git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-paper-title-generation.git<br>
3.cd research-paper-title-generation<br>
4.Download the pre-trained model checkpoint and place it in the models directory.<br> <br>

Run the title generation script:<br>

1.bash <br>
2.Copy code <br>
3.python generate_title.py --input_text "Your research paper content goes here." <br>
4.Replace "Your research paper content goes here." with the actual content of your research paper. <br>

The generated title will be displayed in the console. <br> <br>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The model in this repository was trained on a dataset of research papers and their corresponding titles. If you wish to train your own model, you can use a similar dataset or collect one according to your specific domain.

<h3>Model Architecture</h3>
The model architecture used in this repository is based on a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned for title generation.

<h3>Training</h3>
If you want to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it on your own dataset, refer to the training instructions provided in the train.ipynb notebook.

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
We used various evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated titles. These metrics are detailed in the evaluation.ipynb notebook.

<h3>Results</h3>
You can find the results and evaluation of the model in the results.md file.

<h3>Contributing</h3>
We welcome contributions to improve this research paper title generation project. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements.
